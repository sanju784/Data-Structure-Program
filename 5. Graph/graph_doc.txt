Graph is set of objects connected by link.
The objects are called Vertices (V) and the link which connects these objects are called edges (E).
The graph is represented as (V, E).

a 0------0 b
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
c 0------0------0
         d      e

Where V = {a,b,c,d,e}
      E = {ab, ac, bd, cd, de}

A graph can be represented as array of vertices and 2-D array of edges.

Adjacency - Two nodes or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.
Path - Path represents a sequence of edges between 2 vertices.

Basic graph operations are
1. Add vertex to graph.
2. Add an edge between 2 vertices.
3. Display a vertex of graph.

DFS - uses stack. In this only one i.e. the first found adjacent node is pushed to the stack.

BFS - uses queue. In BFS all unvisited node adjacent to current node are enqueued.

Graphp Alogrithms -
1. DFS and BFS - to traverse a graph or search in a graph.

2. Topological Sort - It is only for DAG, it is linear ordering of vertices such that for directed edge uv, u comes before v in ordering

3. Shortest Path Algorithm - Dijkstra, Bellman-Form Algorithm

4. Minimum Spanning tree - Prim's, Kruskal's Alogirthm
